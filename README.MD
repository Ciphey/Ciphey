# What is this?
Ciphey is an automated decryption tool. Input encrypted text, get the decrypted text back.
> "What type of encryption?"

That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.

Ciphey uses a deep neural network to guess what something is encrypted with, and then a custom built natural language processing module to determine the output.

Ciphey can solve most things in about 2 seconds.

# Features

- **20+ encryptions supported** such as hashes, encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, Transposition and more.
- **Deep neural network for targetting the right decryption** resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds. If Ciphey cannot decrypt the text, Ciphey will use the neural network analysis to give you information on how to decrypt it yourself.
- **Custom built natural language processing module** Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. It has an incredibly high accuracy, along with being fast.
- **Multi Language Support** at present, only English.
- **Supports hashes & encryptions** Which the alternatives such as CyberChef do not. 

# Getting Started
## Installation
### Pip
```pip3 install ciphey```

```ciphey -t "encrypted text here"```
To run ciphey.

### Cloning from GitHub
```git clone https://github.com/brandonskerritt/ciphey```
cd ciphey && python3 ciphey -t "encrypted text here"```
To run ciphey
### Running Ciphey
To get rid of the progress bars, probability table, and all the noise use the grep mode.
```ciphey -t "encrypted text here" -g```
For a full list of arguments, run `ciphey -h`.

It is also possible to pipe data into Ciphey, or to use Ciphey like `ciphey 'encrypted text here'`
### Importing Ciphey
You can import Ciphey\'s __main__ and use it in your own programs and code.
This is feature is expected to expand in the next version.

Ciphey was invented by [Brandon Skerritt](https://github.com/brandonskerritt) way back in 2008 (don't worry, the code has upgraded since then ðŸ˜œ) but it wouldn't be where it is today without [Cyclic3](https://github.com/Cyclic3).
