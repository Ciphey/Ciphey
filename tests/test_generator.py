"""
Create a class that can generate encryptions that ciphey can decrypt
This class takes a random string from a large corpus of data and returns it as :
{"Cipher": c, "Plaintext": p, "CipherUsed": cu, "Succeeds": true}

It would also be good if it could return randomly generate text / plaintext too, so we can get some failure test cases.

This class is used to create the class that contains the tests.
So it'll have a format like:

def test_description(self):
        assert(t, equal)
where t is the decrypted text from Ciphey, and equal is the decrypted text.

So this function does like:

for i in range(1, 20000):
    grabCipher = grabCipher()
    # this returns a random cipher, encrypted text and plaintext combo
    toAppend ='''
    def test_{cipher}_{suceeds}_{plaintext[0:10]}(textToTest):
        cipheyObj = ciphey(text)
        output = cipheyObj.decrypt()
        assert(output, {plaintext})
    '''
    file.append()
